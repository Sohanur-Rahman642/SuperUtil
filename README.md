# SuperUtil
A JavaScript utility library with four functions supported currently 
- **Reverse a given string**
- **Count number of a given substring is present within a given string**
- **Deep merge 2 given objects**
- **For a given date object and a provided timezone, output a string with date formatted and
converted to the given timezone**

## Setup 
- **Open the Codesandbox url in the browser & sign up**
- **Open the terminal into the root folder & run 'npm run test'**

## Usage 
I have maed a command line interface based on the library. All you need to input the number of a functionality to check & follow the instructions.
